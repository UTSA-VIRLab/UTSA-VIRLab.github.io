about: |
  I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), with research interests in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. My overarching goal is to develop robust computational methods for analyzing real-world systems through formal verification, program analysis, software testing, and learning-based approaches.

  Currently, my research centers on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), where I focus on enhancing novel view synthesis techniques, particularly for human rendering. I aim to integrate structural representations and semantic priors—such as TriPlanes—to improve the quality and realism of NeRF-based models.
