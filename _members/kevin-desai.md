about: |
  I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), where Iâ€™ve been since Fall 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) in 2019 and previously served as an Assistant Professor of Instruction at UTSA.

  My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Immersive Technologies (VR/AR/MR), with applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, training, and serious gaming. I focus on 3D human modeling in collaborative virtual environments, including areas like multi-camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, and game design.

  I regularly teach undergraduate and graduate courses such as AI, Computer Vision, and Game Development, and have received funding from NSF (including a prestigious CRII award) and other local sources. My work has been published in top conferences including CVPR, ISMAR, ICME, and DIS, and I actively review for IEEE, ACM, and Springer venues.
