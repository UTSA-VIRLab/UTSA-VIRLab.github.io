about: |
  I’m currently a doctoral student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), where I am conducting research under the supervision of Dr. Kevin Desai. My work focuses on “Conditioned Human Motion Generation,” aiming to explore advanced techniques in 3D human pose modeling and motion synthesis.

  Before joining UTSA, I completed my M.S. and B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Shiraz University, Iran. During this time, I worked extensively on deep learning applications in background subtraction, visual tracking, and sign language recognition using CNNs. My academic journey has been enriched by multiple research assistantships, hands-on projects, and teaching experiences.

  I’m deeply passionate about combining vision-language modeling, temporal sequence modeling, and multimodal learning to advance human-centric AI. My long-term goal is to build robust and generalizable models that bridge the gap between real-world motion and AI-driven understanding.

  - Human Motion Generation
  - 3D Human Pose Estimation
  - Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs)
  - Motion Capture and Retargeting
  - Temporal Sequence Modeling
  - Pose-conditioned Image/Video Generation
